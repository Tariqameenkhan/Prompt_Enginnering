## Introduction üìö
Prompt engineering is the art of designing inputs (prompts) that elicit desired outputs from AI models. This guide covers fundamental principles and provides actionable examples for effective communication with AI systems.

## Key Concepts üîë
1. **Clarity**: Be specific about desired output
2. **Context**: Provide relevant background information
3. **Constraints**: Set boundaries for responses
4. **Examples**: Demonstrate preferred format/style
5. **Iteration**: Refine prompts through testing

## Best Practices ÔøΩ
‚úÖ Do:
- Start with clear instructions
- Use delimiters for complex prompts
- Specify output format
- Provide reference examples
- Break down complex tasks

‚ùå Avoid:
- Ambiguous phrasing
- Assumed context
- Open-ended questions (when specific answers needed)
- Overly complex sentences
- Multiple instructions in one prompt

## Example Prompts üí°

### Basic Example
**Poor Prompt:**  
"Write about dogs"

**Improved Prompt:**  
"Write a 150-word informative paragraph about golden retrievers, focusing on their temperament and suitability as family pets. Use simple language understandable by middle school students."

### Intermediate Example
**Task:** Text summarization

# Chain of Thought Prompting

## One-shot Chain of Thought Prompting

**Q**: In a football match, 11 players in each team. One team has 11 players: one goalkeeper and 10 outfield players. 
In 10 outfield players, 2 players take an injury and one has not come. How many outfield players are required?

**A**: 11 players consist of one goalkeeper and 10 outfield players. Since two outfield players are injured, and one has not come, 3 outfield players are required.

# Least-to-Most Prompting

**Definition**: Least-to-most (LTM) prompting breaks down a problem into sub-problems and solves them sequentially. 
The output of previous sub-problems is used as input for the next.
